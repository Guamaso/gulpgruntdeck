# Gulp and Grunt

You have a lot of things to do. Your project is full of dependencies. You want to keep the project lean and fast. You, my friend, need an automation tool. 

Gulp and Grunt are automation tools that run in a Node environment.  Each solves the problem of automation in their own little way.  Using some JavaScript and JSON know how, you can use either tool to automate your workflow or other common tasks. 

Learn what the differences are; the strengths and weaknesses of each tool, to improve your workflow, reduce errors, and save you time. 

We will review the "code versus configuration" argument. Do you want to write your automation scripts using an easy to use API? Or do you prefer to just have the tool step through a plan and do its thing? 

Together we will explore and learn the basics of both tools with the goal of finding out which is the right fit for your workflow.. 

Whether you write code, publish a blog, or want to keep your Dropbox folder clean, automation is the way to go. 

## Notes

I have included the impress presentation as well as the grunt and gulp sandbox (I added the commands I used to start the projects in a markdown file as well).

I also left the photo organization gulp project in the examples folder.

Hope this helps someone!
