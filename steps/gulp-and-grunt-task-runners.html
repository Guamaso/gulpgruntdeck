	<li>Gulp</li>
  <li>Others?</li>
</ul>

<p class="small">You are here for a Gulp/Grunt showdown. Sorry. No winners here. It isn't about the tool, it's about the problem you are trying to solve.  Still, let's limit the scope to Gulp and Grunt.</p>

<div class="notes">

Now that you have your task broken down into steps, let's take a look at the automation landscape.

<ul>
  <li>Bamboo and Jenkins are great. Run on Java. Good eco-systems. Marketed as build systems but are really just task runners themselves.</li>
  <li>Grunt - Front end dev tool of choice. Runs on Node.js. Very healthy eco-system.</li>
  <li>Gulp - The new guy; the challenger; the underdog. Runs on Node.js.  Eco-system is good and getting better.</li>
</ul>
