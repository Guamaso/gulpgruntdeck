<h2>Gulp and Grunt: TASK RUNNERS.</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Bamboo and Jenkins</li>
	<li>Grunt</li>
	<li>Gulp</li>
  <li>Others?</li>
</ul>

<p class="small">This isn't a tool showdown. It's a figure-out-which-tool-works-for-you-down.</p>

<div class="notes">

Now that you have your task broken down into steps, let's take a look at the automation landscape.

Bamboo/Jenkins have GUI, Gulp/Grunt do not. This is due to abstraction of task runner and plugins/tasks.

<ul>
  <li>Bamboo and Jenkins are great. Run on Java. Good eco-systems. Marketed as build systems but are really just task runners themselves.</li>
  <li>Grunt - Front end dev tool of choice. Runs on Node.js. Very healthy eco-system.</li>
  <li>Gulp - The new guy; the challenger; the underdog. Runs on Node.js.  Eco-system is good and getting better.</li>
</ul>

This isn't a tool showdown. Where we will explore the tools we will focus on applying the tools to the problem you are trying to solve.

Try not to polarize our industry. Some tools might actually be better by some standards, but this isn't always the case; keep an open mind.

Don't focus on finding a problem for your solution. Apply solutions we know to the problems we experience as the present themselves.
