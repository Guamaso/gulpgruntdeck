<h2>Gulp!</h2>

<p class="clear">Uses code, the Gulp API, and plugins to configure tasks.</p>

<p>Ecosystem isn't bad, but it's not Grunt level... yet.</p>

<p><a href="">Review Gulpfile.js for website.</a></p>

<div class="notes">
Very similar to Grunt in that it runs off of Node. 
A little simpler to get started but much more complex to configure a task. 
Especially if you are not familiar with asynchronous nature of Node.
