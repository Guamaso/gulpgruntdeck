<h2>Your workflow needs... ?</h2>

<p>Do you know JS? Do you like it? Do you have free time? Use Gulp.</p>

<p>Does JS confuse you and make you want to <span class="hulk">HULK SMASH</span>? Are you using this for client/work work? Use Grunt.</p>

<p>Learn one, then learn the other.</p>


<div class="notes">
<p>Documentation on either can be spotty, mostly good, but sometimes spotty.</p>

<p>Gulp is still in development and it's hard to keep up. I found articles that explain how to use it but for an older outdated version.</p>

<p>Grunt is great... when the documentation makes sense. Configuration crashes hard when the documentation isn't clear or is non-existent. TONS of plugins.</p>

<p>I learned Gulp first, then Grunt. Grunt was hard for me at first but was easier when revisiting after learning Gulp. Learning both is important.</p>
